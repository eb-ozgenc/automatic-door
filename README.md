# Automatic-Door
In this term project for my Bilkent EEE 102 course, I implemented an automatic door made with servo motors, a 4x4 keypad and an IR sensor. Because of ome hardware issues of my BASYS-3 FPGA, I needed to implement a small portion of the project (multiplexer and mode select) using external components like MOSFET and 74LS153 Multiplexer. All details are included in the project report uploaded.
