# Automatic-Door
In this term project for my Bilkent EEE 102 course, I implemented an automatic door with BASYS-3 FPGA and VHDL using Vivado ML edition. I used and drived 2 servo motors, a 4x4 keypad and an IR sensor. Because of some hardware issues of my BASYS-3, I needed to implement a small portion of the project (multiplexer and mode select) using external components like MOSFET and 74LS153 Multiplexer. All details are included in the project report uploaded.
